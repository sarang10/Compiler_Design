Compiler Design Experiments

List of Experiments:

1. Program to convert NFA to DFA.
2. Program for acceptance of string by DFA. 
3. Program to find different tokens in a program.
4. Program to implement Lexical Analyser.
5. Program to implement recursive descent parser.
6. Program to left factor the given grammar 
7. Program to convert left recursive grammar to right recursive grammar.
8. Program to compute FIRST and FOLLOW.
9. Program to construct LL(1) parsing table.
10. Program to implement non recursive predictive parsing. 

The details of all the programs and their algorithms are written inside each folder corresponding ot the experiment.
